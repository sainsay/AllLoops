## Infinight
4 fixed lenght loopers. 

Each looper has 2 tracks.
The length of each looper is slightly offset, Creating independant patterns that rhythmically interact.

The inputs mono 1 & 2 are send to their respective track on all loopers.
Send and return ports allow for any combination of effects to be added in the looping cycle. Send output 1 & 2 are 4 channel polyphonic for each looper a channel. Return accepts a mono cable in which case it behaves like the main inputs or it can accept 4 channel polyphony for each looper on chanel in the same order as the send ports.
